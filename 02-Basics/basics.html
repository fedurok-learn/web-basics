      <p>
        Your mother is just one bright <em><strong>sunshine ray in this dark world</strong></em>. 
        She loves thinging and making dishes. Also she wise enough to give smart advices. 
        Last time i saw her, she helped me a lot with my <strong>big</strong> problem.
        So i hope she is doing well and you'll take care of her.
